* About me: *26 y.o., from Bashkortostan, Russia. Graduated from Akmulla Bashkir State Pedagogical University, acquired a qualification as an English language teacher. During COVID-19 got Master's degree in Bussines-communication, and at the same time got interested in programming. I didn't start studying till much later, because I was afraid I was not really shaped for this industry. But after trying all kinds of tutorials, I found out I honestly like it! In addition, I realised I used to 'play' with HTML, when I was 14-15 y.o. I did section 'Menu' in communities of VKontakte - could do it for hours - but I never considered this hobby as a future career! Now, I intend to become THE software-engineer, who knows his work very well!*
